Geomagnetic and charged particle detection

A search coil magnetometer vs a fluxgate magnetometer (or maybe use both?)

Long coil length search coil magnetometer such as LEMI-120

3 axis magnetometer to measure the geomagnetic effects 

Have several PMT's that could be used with a scintillation crystal (or two different types of crystal?)

CAN bus implementation
https://matthewtran.dev/2020/01/setting-up-the-can-bus-on-stm32/

CAN appears to not be suited to DMA, so should be interrupt driven in it's IO and message handling.

Most of the device operation should be interrupt driven with some scheduled jobs such as filtering data, communication, and storing information to non-volatile memory
