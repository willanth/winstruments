Analog signal processing

Temp and Humidity from [[HMP45A]] is 0-1V range.  Humidity is 0-100% +/- 1% over this range.  Temp is -40 / +60C in a 0-1V range +/- 0.2C

The STM32L432 has a 16-bit ADC that full-scales at 3.3v.  This provides a voltage per ADC step of:
2^16 = 65535
3.3 / 65535 = 50.355uV / ADC bit

This means that there will be approximately 
1V / 50.355uV = 19859 ADC steps 
for the given measurement range.

Resolution calculations for humidity and temperature

approximately 
100 / 19859 = 0.005% RH per ADC step

100 / 19859 = 0.005C per ADC step 

Expect that the inbuilt 16 bit ADC will be sufficient for this sensor

ADC noise at low signal ranges (very low temperature or humidity) will contaminate readings, however the likelyhood that these conditions will occur in the area where the equipment will be used is practically zero.

Circuit protection devices for induced currents (RF coupling to radio equipment, lightning etc)

Probably TI ESDS304 for GPIO signals (3V3 nominal)

Probably TI ESD2CAN device to protect CANBUS signals

DC power input protection?  Nominal bus voltage 24V
Possible TI ESD752 protection diodes
