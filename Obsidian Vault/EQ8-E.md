Output is given as 1mV/W.m^-2 

This is only 20 (19.85) ADC steps.  At very low irradience values, this signal could get lost in the noise.

Quantization means that we will have uncertainty of the measurement 50uV, approximately 1 ADC step.  

#TODO what is this in W.m^-2 ?


The dynamic range of this measurement is large, as it can be several volts at full sun.  Maybe require a 5V ADC?
